# Conclusion

The rust book, is finally over now its time to build projects without the help of AI or help codes. 
Also the only chapter is skipped was 20 -> Advance Features, As I kept it for only reference, reading now
would not make sense for me right now.

## Next steps

I am planning to build beginner to advance projects from the blog -> https://codecrafters.io/blog/rust-projects 
THe blogs have resources to refer and have an incremental difficulty!!

Note -> No, AI will be used in any of the project (Hopefully)! 
If you want to check my vibe_code projects (basically frontends) check -> https://github.com/ayush-agrawal001/vibe-coded-frontends

Peace out!
